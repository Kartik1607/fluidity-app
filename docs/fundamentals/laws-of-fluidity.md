# 👩🏫 Laws of Fluidity

Fluidity is built with three hard constraints:

### Instant rewards

Rewards should be relatively instant. Users love a responsive application that doesn't take time to reward them for using it.

### No extra fees

In some cases, Fluid Assets are **cheaper than other standard ERC20 tokens** to transact. This feeds into the Fluidity objective of **financial inclusion** and that blockchain technology is not exclusively for the wealthy to use.

### No special software

Users and protocols win rewards for using Fluid Assets without any special software. You are free to use what you want to transact Fluid Assets, with no restrictions.
