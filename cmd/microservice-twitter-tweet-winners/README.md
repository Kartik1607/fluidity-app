# Microservice Twitter Tweet Winners

Gets winners off the queue, finds the user action associated with it,
gets the amount that was sent/used, identifies the application that is
in use using Arbiscan, then tweets the hashtag associated with that
project with a link to the webapp and the transaction hash.
